Requests:
- Please do not post your requests about minimap. Tired to answear again and again: It is not mine! It is minimized ZoS ingame map. If you want something else then use other minimaps.
- Requests, that sounds like "I want you to do for me this" will be ignored.
- If you want something to be added or changed, ask your self "Is it really good and unique idea?". Useless requests will be declined.
- If you want something from other add-on then simply use that add-on.

Important:
- NEVER use more than one add-on with ultimate sharing or you will be kicked from server. (Stats, DPS sharing in Bandits UI, Ultimate sharing in Raid Notifier, Taos Group Ultimate, Hodor Reflexes, etc.)
- Do not use different add-ons with the same function. (Notifications in Bandits UI, Raid Notifier, Blackrose Prison Helper, Asylum Tracker, etc.)
- Do not use several different UI add-ons at the same time.

Frequently asked questions:
- If you lost textures then check add-on path. It must be precisely "AddOns\BanditsUserInterface", not "AddOns\BanditsUserInterface\BanditsUserInterface", not "AddOns\BanditsUserInterface 3.200", etc. Remember to restart the game after the first addon installation.
- If you have a question about some option then mouseover it and read description before asking your question.
- If some parts of the interface stops working then check an other addons, especially ones with the corresponding functionality (or simply disable all addons and! libraries for a test).
